I tried to make vim a bit compatible with my old editors, so I maped CTRL+C, CTRL+V, CTRL+Y to copy, paste, del and so on, made Shift+Arrows work in insert mode as "v" does in normal mode, popup auto complete menu as you type, map CTRL+Right, CTRL+Left to next/prev buffer in normal mode, CTRL+N, CTRL+x to new/del buffer, and some custom settings.

Don't misunderstand me, I really like vim keys, but for now I needed some compatibility with my old editor, so I thought it may be useful for someone too.

Any feedback/addition/note/idea is more than welcome.
